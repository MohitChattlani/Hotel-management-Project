# Hotel-management-Project
I have tried to computerize the hotel management system through my project.The project is written in Python 3 that uses OOPS concept ie it is based on object and classes.
The project minimizes the manual work of the employee of hotel management team and store/modify the bill details of the customer.Check out the code and if anything is wrong or missing please create an issue and do let me know.
